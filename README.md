# stock_analysis

# Background
Steve is grateful for your help and loves the workbook you prepared for him. What he doesn’t love, however, are the returns on the stocks in 2018. Steve wants to do a little more research for his parents and is gathering data for the entire stock market over the last few years. While your code works great for a dozen stocks, it might not work so well for thousands of stocks. (Remember, you had to loop through all of the stock data for each ticker you analyzed.)

To help Steve, refactor your code. Remember, refactoring is like writing another draft of your code. You aren’t trying to add new functionality—you just want to make the code more efficient, whether by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or making the code easier to read.

# Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

Analyze code and explain how it accomplishes a task.
Evaluate logic flow of for loops and conditionals.
Extend your pattern recognition skills to refactor existing code.

# Challenge
Based on the stock returns from 2017 and 2018, the stocks that Steve would recommend that consistently did well and had positive gains were ENPH and RUN.  Although the rest of the stocks had negative returns in 2018, some of them such as SEDG which had a +185% return in 2017 but -8% loss in 2018 should not be entirely dismissed considering the return in 2017 might makeup for the 2018 loss.  Overall, stocks are risky and Steve can show his parents that there might be a few stocks that are worth investing because of consistent returns while others such as TERP can be dropped due to consistent negative returns.
